    <h3>I originally saw this problem in a <a href="https://www.pearsonhighered.com/product/Schneider-Introduction-to-Programming-Using-Visual-Basic-2010-8th-Edition/9780132128568.html">
      Visual Basic Book by David Schneider</a>.<br />
      So, this is not an original problem that I created, but I thought this was appropriate to use in any programming language and its open to many possibilites</h3>
      <h4>This problem illustrates the use of objects, arrays and loops</h4>
      <p>We're all probably familiar with the <a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/12-days-of-christmas-lyrics-christmas-song.html">"12 Days of Christmas"</a> carol.

        A company called <a href="http://content.pncmc.com/live/pnc/microsite/CPI/#explained">PNC in Philadelphia comes up with a Christmas Price Index </a>
        which tracks the yearly increase in price of the gifts from the 12 Days of Christmas.

        Here is a link to the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/pnc-christmas-index-12-days-of-christmas-2015-2015-12">Christmas Price Index of 2015</a>

        For this problem, the user enters a number between 1-12(both numbers inclusive) and the program calculates the cost of the gift for that day, as well as the cumulative total spent by the poor sap until that specific day.
      </p>
      <p><input size="10" id="dayNumber"> Enter the Day number</p>
      <button type="button" id="calcButton" onclick="calculateCostSolution()">Calculate the damage</button>
